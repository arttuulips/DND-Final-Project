This documentation provides an overview of the development process and features of a Travel Blog application built using Blazor WebAssembly and a RESTful Web API. The application enables users to register, log in, and share travel stories through blog posts, while offering administrators role-based access for managing content. The platform also allows users to filter and browse blog posts by various criteria, enhancing the overall user experience. 

Throughout the development, the team collaborated closely to ensure the application met the project requirements, using Blazor for the frontend and .NET for the backend. This documentation highlights key features, challenges faced, and solutions implemented during the project’s lifecycle.
